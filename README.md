# Computer Vision Project-3

## Introduction

The field of computer vision has emerged as a transformative force, empowering machines to comprehend and interpret visual data from images and videos. This project specifically centers on applying bird detection in images utilizing the YOLOv3 model. Birds play a crucial role in ecosystems, and understanding their populations and behaviors is important for conservation efforts and ecological studies. The implementation of bird detection, facilitated by the YOLOv3 model, will aid conservationists in identifying birds amidst diverse environmental conditions. The dataset used for the project contains diverse images with various backgrounds, lighting conditions, and bird species. Apart from showcasing the technical capabilities of computer vision algorithms, this project emphasizes their practical significance in advancing wildlife monitoring and ornithology research.
